# Dimensionality-Reduction-and-Association-Analysis

## Introduction
This project contains 2 parts.<br>
* Part 1 consists of implementing Principal Component Analysis algorithm from scratch without using any libraries for PCA.<br>
The goal is to project high dimensional data to 2 dimensions, and visualize the results. 
* Part 2 consists of performing Association analysis by implementing the Apriori algorithm from scratch without using 
any apriori libraries.<br>
The goal is to generate Association rules and then mine those rules based on given constraints.
The format of these constraints are mentioned in the template.pdf

## Dimensionality Reduction
Given a high dimensional data, we projected this data to 2 dimensions, by implementing following techniques - <br>
* Principal component analysis - PCA (implemented from scratch) 
* Singular Value Decomposition - SVD 
* t-SNE

## Association Analysis
Based on the given gene data, we implemented the Apriori Algorithm from scratch and generated frequent itemsets <br> for given support. 
Generated Association rules based on the generated frequent itemsets for given confidence.<br> Mined association rules based on the constraints provided in template.
